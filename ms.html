            <h2>How to Play Minesweeper</h2>
            <p>Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game. The goal is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.</p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Left Click</strong> a tile to reveal what is underneath it.</li>
                <li><strong>Right Click</strong> (or hold, on mobile devices) to place flags on tiles you suspect contain bombs.</li>
                <li>The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are adjacent to a square. For example, if a square has a "3" on it, that means there are 3 bombs adjacent to that square.</li>
                <li>Use these clues to safely clear all the non-mined squares.</li>
            </ul>
